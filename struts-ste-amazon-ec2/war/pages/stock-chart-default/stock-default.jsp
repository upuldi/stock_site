        <h2>Stock Charts</h2>
        <p>We have various type of stock charts available in here. </p>
        <h3>Line Chart</h3>
        <p></p><p>A line chart or line graph is a type of graph, which displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. It is an extension of a scatter graph, and is created by connecting a series of points that represent individual measurements with line segments. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically</p>
        <h3>Candlestick Chart</h3>
        <p></p><p>A candlestick chart is a style of bar-chart used primarily to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency over time.</p>
        <p>It is a combination of a line-chart and a bar-chart, in that each bar represents the range of price movement over a given time interval. It is most often used in technical analysis of equity and currency price patterns. They appear superficially similar to error bars, but are unrelated.</p>
        <h3>OHLC (Open-high-low-close) Chart</h3>
        <p></p><p>An open-high-low-close chart (also OHLC chart, or simply bar chart) is a type of chart typically used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. Each vertical line on the chart shows the price range (the highest and lowest prices) over one unit of time, e.g. one day or one hour. Tick marks project from each side of the line indicating the opening price (e.g. for a daily bar chart this would be the starting price for that day) on the left, and the closing price for that time period on the right. The bars may be shown in different hues depending on whether prices rose or fell in that period.</p>
